## unxsBase

Since some pieces of unxsVZ software have been successful and 
automated code generation based on DB SChema will always be useful,
the unxsVZ repo is being refactored and will try to be cleaned up
to minimum standards of industry best practices.

unxsVZ is full of junky ancient code "do it fast now code" that is
very much replicated ad nauseum into a mess of duplication and global vars.
It needs to be cleaned up and modernized!

### Roadmap

unxsRAD make sure it can generate complete node.js APIs and
MEAN/MERN or even MySQL.Express.Angular/React.NodeJS frontend development scaffolding.

unxsBind create complete Docker based distribution with
automated DNS based provisioning and service discovery.

While this is being done the common lib and common css/jc/html/images
will be de-duplicated and refactored into object oriented cleaned up
code.
